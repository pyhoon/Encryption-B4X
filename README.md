# Encryption-B4X
Base64 and Encryption library by agraham (for B4J)

This library can perform Base64 encoding and decoding, Signing, MACs, asymmetric and symmetric algorithm encryptions and decryptions. \
Tested symmetric algorithms are DES, Triple DES and AES (Rijndael).

As the Java encryption rountines are all byte array oriented you will also need agraham's ByteConverter (Internal) library to run the demo.
