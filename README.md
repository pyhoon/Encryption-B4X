# Encryption-B4X
B4X Base64 and Encryption library by agraham

Here's a library that, for the moment, can perform Base64 encoding and decoding and symmetric algorithm encryption and decryption. Tested symmetric algorithms are DES, Triple DES and AES (Rijndael).

As the Java encryption rountines are all byte array oriented you will need my ByteConverter library to run the demo.

EDIT :- Version 1.1 posted. Asymmetric algorithms, Signing and MACs now implemented. See post#2 for details.
